# Smart Watering System

> This repo is for a "Self-Watering" system it is also my first of many projects to come. 

The Smart-Watering system would provide a live update display in Graphical represention of your plant's soil moisture level, the time of day, water levels, and if it has been wet by the "Smart-Watering" system, our an outside source, such as rain, or manual watering. 

| Moisture Level | Water Level |  Time of Day |
|   ---    |    ---     |   ---     |   ---     |
| 85% |  25% 😳 | 05:45 |
| 75% |    23% ⚠️   |  05:55 |
| 45% | 14% 🔥 |    16:55 |
This is all to be smart and also self sustainable by running off recycled water and a solar panel to reduce the carbon footprint of the device.
